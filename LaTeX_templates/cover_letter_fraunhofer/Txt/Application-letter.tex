\section{Wissenschaftliche*r Mitarbeiter*\\ in \\Data Science in der Produktion (66273)}
Dear Christin Scheurer,

I would like to think that there are still some people left that prefer the concise genuine cover letter to the long-winded ChatGPT equivalent and therefore here is mine.

\noindent{\large{Why Fraunhofer?}}\\
I would say wanting to work at Fraunhofer is kind of natural. The entity 
is stable and has close relations with Stuttgart University as well as industrial stakeholders. 
I have also had a couple of interactions in general with other Fraunhofer branches and all of them were good so far. Basically what is there not to like?
% \noindent{\large{Deep Learning}}\\
% As we know while Deep Learning solves quite a number of classically intractable problems, it also brings a couple of \text{disadvantages} to the table. 
% \text{Explainable/Model Based} approaches are a class of approaches designed to remedy the said disadvantages. During my master thesis I got introduced to \text{Deep Unfolding} which is 
% can be classified into Explainable Deep Learning/AI and designed to improve iterative solutions using \text{custom made} artificial neural networks. 

\noindent{\large{Why Me?}}\\
Due to my MSc and BSc being in different fields and my Mathematical + Coding = Computational prowess I think I can bring much to the table. 
Whether I can or can not work in a research like environment is also corroborated by my professors in their letters of recommendation. 
I currently have 3; one of them from my MSc at RWTH and two of them from my BSc days at SUT.

\noindent{\large{Track Record}}\\
I was at \textbf{top universities} both during my BSc and MSc and was objectively successful; corroborated by my \textbf{transcripts} and recommendation letters. I can adapt to different cultures and atmosphere quite easily and have indomitable will.
