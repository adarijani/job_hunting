To Whom It May Concern,

\noindent{\large{Not a ChatGPT Cover Letter}}\\
I would like to think that there are still some people left that prefer the concise genuine cover letter to the long-winded ChatGPT equivalent and therefore here is mine.

\noindent{\large{Why Genedata?}}\\
I did not have much experience with Genedata in the past but it gave me the impression that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item It passed the test of time.
    \item The atmosphere seem to be international
    \item And the size of company is in the margin that I like which is not too big and not too small.
\end{itemize} 
which are important factors for me therefore here I am applying for a role there.

\noindent{\large{Me as Numerical and C++ guy }}\\
I went through numerous numerical oriented courses and research positions throughout the years. Numerical Methods for PDEs, Sparse Learn Algebra, Computational Geometry were amongst the most important ones. 
Quite naturally when the computations become intensive one of the possible routes is to get closer to bare metal. I quite proficient in C++ and in general high-performance computing and 
when the need arises I am not the one to back down from the challenge. 

\noindent{\large{Track Record}}\\
I was at \text{top universities} both during my BSc and MSc and was 
objectively successful; corroborated by my \text{transcripts} and 
\text{recommendation letters}. Kept the high standard of quality 
during my Research Assistant positions. I can adapt to different 
cultures and work atmospheres quite easily and fit into them seamlessly.
