\section{Software Developer: \\Digital Twin \\ \hspace*{3em}\& \\Edge Cloud Computing \\in Production}
Dear Philipp Ganser,

Hope this letter finds you well. The other day at the grill we had a talk about a couple of positions at Fraunhofer IPT and by the
impression I got and my background I decided to formally present my case.\\\\
Working in high-performance computing and Simulation Sciences implies the Linux, SSH, SLURM, remote development
 and the usual technics and tools which I acquired during my studies. I am confident I can keep up the pace in Cloud Computing 
 be it in-house infrastructure or commercialized solutions(AWS, GCP, and Azure).\\\\
 Almost all Simulation Sciences courses require strong programming prowess in C/C++, Python and an extensive set of 
 tools to be able to handle your computing tasks. Can-do attitude will be engraved into your DNA and Googling becomes 
 your middle name after you finish the degree.\\\\
 I am methodical, scrupulous, punctual, and not afraid to face new challenges. I did my bachelor in 
 Mechanical Engineering at my home country and my master in Simulation Sciences here in another continent 
 which I guess everybody would agree are totally different yet I triumphed corroborated by my transcripts and 
 the recommendation letters of my supervisors.\\\\  
 In case you needed additional documents or details feel free to reach out to me.
 % BSc in Mechanical Engineering and MSc in Simulation Sciences with 2.2 and 1.9 corresponding GPAs is what makes me an ideal candidate 
% at least on paper.\\\\
% Having an extensive list of graduate level courses related to the advertised position Numerical Methods(FEM/FVM)(1.7), 
% Tensor Calculus I/II(1.3/1.0), Continuum Mechanics(2)(1.7/2.0), Practical FEM(ANSYS)(1.7) and a couple of others can clearly confirm my 
% claims.\\\\
% I also have experience in FEniCS Project and can formulate Continuum Mechanics related problem or in general Partial Differential Equations 
% to the so-called ``The Unified Form Language(UFL)'' and run simulations. I have enough mathematical and programming expertise 
% to resort to ``deal.II'' in order to utilize distributed computing if the challenge arises.\\\\


% My master thesis is about Deep Unfolding of Wirtinger Flow Schemes which is a combination of 
% Deep Learning and a class of iterative algorithms designed to solve Phase Retrieval Problem in Image Processing.
% It enabled me to see the bigger picture in Machine Learning Frameworks(PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras) as in seeing them as a 
% combination of fast vectorized generic algorithms, first-order stochastic based generic optimizers, 
% and finally computational differentiation algorithms which are still quite magical to me. Combined with the 
% power of innate data manipulators and GPU accelerated backbones(CUDA), given that you have the computational power and 
% quality data, you can almost do anything.   

% While having quality data is an indispensable asset to have in your arsenal, there is no such thing as the perfect 
% world and that is where Image Processing can shine in the autonomous driving and computer vision context. 
%  I have rather a solid mathematical and practical understanding of filters, kernels, 
%  frequency and multi-scale methods(Fourier and Wavelet transforms) which can remedy and address a good portion 
%  of the problems that can happen. Variational Image Processing is getting attention to solve those 
%  intractable problems that Classical Image Processing can not. I have some experience in that too and continually 
%  trying to make it more mature and applicable.

% MSc in Simulation Sciences from RWTH with a GPA of 1.9, and having passed 17 highly CS, Math -based courses is what makes me 
% an ideal candidate at least on paper.
