\section{Experienced ML Scientists (f/m/x) JR\_1008583}
To Whom It May Concern,

\noindent{\large{Not a ChatGPT Cover Letter}}\\
I would like to think that there are still some people left that prefer the concise genuine cover letter to the long-winded ChatGPT equivalent and therefore here is mine.

\noindent{\large{Why ZEISS?}}\\
My supervisor, Prof. Benjamin Berkels, believes in ZEISS and the level of research being done there and 
quite naturally I like to be part of it. That is pretty much it. 

\noindent{\large{Me as a ML/CV Scientist}}\\
Got interested in image processing/computer vision during a university workshop and subsequently attended 
two graduate courses offered by Prof. Benjamin Berkels, \textbf{Mathematical Image Processing} and \textbf{Variational Image Processing}, which got me hooked.
Did a very interesting thesis on \textbf{Deep Unfolding}, an \textbf{Explainable AI} approach, which is bringing the best of \textbf{Deep Learning} and iterative solutions in Image Processing together.


\noindent{\large{Track Record}}\\
I was at \textbf{top universities} both during my BSc and MSc and was 
objectively successful; corroborated by my \textbf{transcripts} and 
\textbf{recommendation letters}. Kept the high standard of quality 
during my Research Assistant positions. I can adapt to different 
cultures and work atmospheres quite easily and fit into them seamlessly.
